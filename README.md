# PERSONAL PORTFOLIO

This website is lowkey so crammed because I am trying to submit it in time for Hack Club's High Seas.
## Features
- Links to my Github, Instagram and Email
- Shows some of my favorite projects
- Shows my skills (Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS)

**If you leave all the criteria empty it will randomly select ideas from the json**

## Thanks and Getting Started
Work in progress (Obviously! I want to keep the Terminal/Console look while being creative, so I WILL work on this soon.) **Suggestions and feedback are always happily accepted!**

(Thanks to Hack Club's High Seas for motivating me to build projects over the last couple of weeks! This program really changed my life and put me well on my way to 
code and keep on learning every day <3)
